# AWS-Events2Panther

This guide will quickly and easily allow a user to deploy an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/){:target="_blank"} function called AWS-Events2Panther to collect AWS events and send them to Panther using the [Panther REST API](../api/index.md), which is a general purpose API that can also be used from the command-line.

AWS events are either region specific or global, depending on the service. Therefore, to get all events to your Panther Console you will have to deploy the AWS-Events2Panther Lambda function to each of your accounts and regions that you wish to monitor.

The AWS-Events2Panther Lambda function [Node.js JavaScript code](https://github.com/OpenAnswers/panther-aws-events/blob/master/e2p/e2p.js){:target="_blank"} can be easily modified to support different AWS events, and/or send different data as part of the message, if required ( [Pull Requests](https://github.com/OpenAnswers/panther-aws-events/pulls){:target="_blank"} welcome ).

Events can be sent to either an [app.panther.support](https://app.panther.support){:target="_blank"} SaaS instance or your own self-hosted [Dockerised container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openanswers/panther-console){:target="_blank"} deployment.

> _**NOTE:** If you are self-hosting Panther through a local `docker` installation, you will need to ensure there is network connectivity from AWS to Panther. It is assumed there will be a TLS reverse proxy sat in front of Panther, if this not the case the Lambda function will need to be modified_


## System Design

This system has been designed to gather AWS events, extract data from them and send it to your Panther Console via the Panther API.

The general flow of events from AWS to Panther is summarised by the following:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![AWSEvents2Panther](./media/aws-to-panther.png)
{: refdef}


1. The Lambda function is triggered whenever a filter matches an event.
2. The Lambda function formats the event data into a [Panther JSON](#panther-json-message) message.
3. The Lambda function sends the message to your Panther Console via the Panther API (over HTTPS) using your private [API key](../api/index.md#api-key).


# Step-by-step

The [panther-aws-events](https://github.com/OpenAnswers/panther-aws-events){:target="_blank"} project is built and deployed to AWS using the Serverless Application Model (SAM):

[docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html){:target="_blank"}

Therefore, to easily build and deploy the Lambda function code to AWS, you must first install SAM.

>_**NOTE:** The AWS SAM tool requires that you have first setup the AWS CLI tools, and that you can use them to access your account.  Amazon/AWS setup instructions will guide you through this process [docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html){:target="_blank"}_

## Installing SAM on Linux

To install SAM on Linux, you can use the [Python 3 installer](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html){:target="_blank"} version:

```
pip3 install aws-sam-cli
```

The official [Amazon SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html){:target="_blank} install guide covers Windows, macOS and Linux and is slightly more involved.


## Checklist

In order to send events from your AWS estate to [Panther](https://app.panther.support){:target="_blank"} you will need to have the following values:

|`APIToken`| Panther [HTTP API Key](/../admin/index.md#api-keys) this will be a long 32 character string of random letters and numbers |
|`APIUrl`| Panther [Event API URL](/../api/index.md) e.g. [https://example.app.panther.support/api/event/create](https://app.panther.support){:target="_blank"} or self-hosted API endpoint |

You will be prompted for these values when deploying to AWS via SAM.


## Installing AWS-Events2Panther

Download the [panther-aws-events](https://github.com/OpenAnswers/panther-aws-events){:target="_blank"} source code from GitHub with:

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenAnswers/panther-aws-events.git
cd panther-aws-events
```

Once the source code has been downloaded, the [panther-aws-events](https://github.com/OpenAnswers/panther-aws-events){:target="_blank"} project needs to be built using the `sam build` command. The panther-aws-events build is dependent on Node.js v12. To build the panther-aws-events project, you need to either install Node.js v12 locally or use the `sam build --use-container` option, which uses an Amazon provided AWS SAM Node.js v12 build container, as detailed below. 

### Building the AWS Lambda function (using Node.js)

If you have `node` v12 installed, you can use this build step:

```console
# Build a Node.js 12 application using a locally installed version of Node.js
sam build
```

> _**NOTE:** Many linux distributions include an old version of `node`. Node.js v12 can be installed for Linux using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm){:target="blank"}._


### Building the AWS Lambda function (using Docker)

If you have `docker` installed, you can use this build step, which has the advantage of being platform agnostic:

```console
# Build a Node.js 12 application using an Amazon container image pulled from DockerHub
sam build --use-container --build-image amazon/aws-sam-cli-build-image-nodejs12.x
```

### Deploying the AWS Lambda function

Using the guided option will interactively prompt for the values from the [checklist](#checklist) above.

```
sam deploy --guided
```

>_**NOTE:** SAM uses the same configuration as the AWS CLI, so if you use many different accounts, ensure that your profile is pointing to the correct account that you wish to install the collector in._

You will then be asked a series of questions to deploy the code to your account and will be prompted for the following values:
  - `APIToken`
  - `APIUrl`

The process will look similar to this:

```
> sam deploy --guided

Successfully created/updated stack - AWS-Events2Panther in eu-west-3
```

## Running 

Once the code has been successfully registered in AWS, you should start seeing a stream of events into your Panther Console.

Manual testing can be done by following the [**Sending some test events**](#sending-some-test-events) instructions.


# Configuring the captured events

There are two approaches to configuring which events will trigger the Lambda function.

* [Adding new YAML config to the SAM template](#generating-new-event-triggers-using-sam) (`template.yaml`) that will generate the triggers for you.

* [Setting up new triggers in the AWS Console](#setting-up-event-triggers-in-the-aws-console).
 
Depending on your use case you may prefer either approach.

## Generating new event triggers using SAM

In the Resources section of the SAM template (`template.yaml`), the PantherMessageProxyFunction contains a section called Events.

You will see that an event trigger has been configured (commented out) that will trigger the Lambda function when a _CloudWatchEvent_ is created that has a source value of aws.guardduty:

```yaml
    GuardDuty:
      Type: CloudWatchEvent
      Properties:
        Pattern:
          Source:
          - aws.guardduty
```

This event pattern will specify the fields to match up when filtering the CloudWatchEvents.

If the filter pattern matches that of the event JSON, it will trigger the function.

If you wish to capture some events, you can uncomment the following line from the start of the _lambdaHandler_ function in the `e2p/e2p.js` file:

```js
    console.log("Event Received: " + JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
```

This will write the event JSON to the CloudWatch Logs log group related to the Lambda function.

Some other examples of pattern filters are, any EC2 instances that are terminated:

```yaml
    EC2Events:
      Type: CloudWatchEvent
      Properties:
        Pattern:
          Source:
          - aws.ec2
          Detail:
            State:
            - terminated
```

Or if you wish to match CloudFormation Lambda code deployment in eu-west-1 or eu-west-2, you could write a filter like this:

```yaml
    LambdaUpdates:
      Type: CloudWatchEvent
      Properties:
        Pattern:
          source:
          - aws-lambda
          Detail:
            AwsRegion:
            - eu-west-1
            - eu-west-2
            UserAgent:
            - cloudformation.amazonaws.com
```

AWS documentation to help you create more filters can be found here (although it's in JSON):

[docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/filtering-examples-structure.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/filtering-examples-structure.html){:target="_blank"}


## Setting up event triggers in the AWS console

The SAM CloudFormation template includes a rule to accept all events, and send them to the Lambda function.

However, you can also disable that one and create your own more specific rules.

Rules can be accessed from two locations:

[console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home){:target="_blank"}

Or here:

[console.aws.amazon.com/events/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/home){:target="_blank"}

On either page you should click on the '__Create rule__' button.

Under __Define pattern__, select __Event pattern__, then select __Pre-defined pattern by service__, select '__AWS__', then select '__All Services__'. This will behave in the same way as CloudTrail, by passing all AWS events to the target. 

As shown below:

![Event pattern - AWS - All Services](./media/aws-define-pattern.png)


Next, under __Select targets__ ensure the target is set to '__Lambda function__', and then select the function id for the one you uploaded. It will be in the format: AWS-Events2Panther-{stack name}

![Select targets - lambda function](./media/aws-select-targets.png)


Once done, you can click on the __Create__ button at the bottom of the page.

# Advanced event filtering

If you wish to only send events to Panther for particular services, you can select '__Custom pattern__', and paste in an event pattern.

![example custom pattern](./media/aws-define-custom-pattern.png)

__Examples of patterns__

## All events from multiple services:

```json
{
  "source": [
    "aws.apigateway",
    "aws.ec2"
  ]
}
```

## A particular event type from a service:

```json
{
  "source": [
    "aws.ec2"
  ],
  "detail-type": [
    "EBS Snapshot Notification"
  ]
}
```

## EC2 instance state change

When an instance has been terminated

```json
{
  "source": [ "aws.ec2" ],
  "detail-type": [ "EC2 Instance State-change Notification" ],
  "detail": {
    "state": [ "terminated" ]
  }
}
```


## Filtering more complex events

Filtering of events can be much more complex, here is Amazons guide:

[docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/filtering-examples-structure.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/filtering-examples-structure.html){:target="_blank"}

You can setup multiple filter rules, each looking for a different type of event from different services that all have the same target Lambda function.

# Configuring the messages sent to Panther

The messages sent to Panther are generated in the JavaScript Lambda function using the information extracted from the JSON AWS event data.

Therefore, to edit the message generated for an event that is already handled, all you have to do is find the correct function and edit it to put the data you wish in the correct fields.

## Currently supported event types

- [AWS API Call via CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/EventTypes.html#events-for-services-not-listed){:target="_blank"}
- [EC2 Instance State-change Notification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/EventTypes.html#ec2_event_type){:target="_blank"}
- [GuardDuty Finding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings_cloudwatch.html#guardduty_findings_cloudwatch_format){:target="_blank"}
- [Security Hub Findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-cwe-event-formats.html){:target="_blank"}
- Config Configuration Item Change

To handle a new event type you should replicate the approach used for other events:

1. Create a new function that accepts a JSON object representing the AWS event data.
2. The source event may contain an array of child events, create one or more Panther message from the source data. The Panther message format can be seen below.
3. Add a new case statement into the `exports.lambdaHandler()` function that calls your new function and puts the returned data into the _data_ variable. The data must be an array of one or more Panther messages.

## Panther JSON message

The Panther JSON message has the following structure:

```json
"event": {
    "node": "thing being monitored",
    "tag": "A tag used for grouping",
    "summary": "A message used to describe the event",
    "severity": 1
}
```

The `severity` is on a scale from 0-5, with
 - 0=clear
 - 1=indeterminate
 - 2=warning, 
 - 3=minor, 
 - 4=major, 
 - 5=critical

## Testing changes locally

SAM can use a local Docker image to test Lambda functions on your machine.

To run the Lambda function with the test data first update the `env.json` file with your values for `APIUrl` and `APIToken` as described in the [checklist](#checklist).

>_**NOTE:** To create a Panther `APIToken` please consult the [admin documentation](../admin/index.md#api-keys)_


```
❯ cat env.json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "API_URL": "https://<PANTHER_NAME>.app.panther.support/api/event/create",
    "API_TOKEN": "<PANTHER_API_TOKEN>"
  }
}
```

Then invoke the Lambda function with:

```
sam build
sam local invoke Events2PantherFunction -e events/<filename>.json --env-vars env.json
```

__NOTE:__ Replace `<filename>.json` with an actual file, some examples are provided in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenAnswers/panther-aws-events/tree/master/events){:target="_blank"}:

  - [`events/guardduty1.json`](https://github.com/OpenAnswers/panther-aws-events/blob/master/events/guardduty1.json){:target="_blank"}
  - [`events/guardduty2.json`](https://github.com/OpenAnswers/panther-aws-events/blob/master/events/guardduty2.json){:target="_blank"}

Sample events can sometimes be found in the AWS documentation, or can be output to the console / CloudWatch Logs. The function will automatically output the event JSON when the processing code causes an exception, or a handler is not available for that particular type of event.

## Checking the logs in AWS

Lambda functions produce log output that is put into a CloudWatch Log group.

Navigate to: [console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logsV2:log-groups){:target="_blank"}

Then look for the log group in the format: `/aws/lambda/AWS-Events2Panther`

![log groups](./media/aws-log-groups.png)

The log group will contain multiple logs written each time the function is triggered by an event.

# Sending some test events

After installation has completed a new Lambda function will have been registered with the supplied __Stack Name__ by default this will be called **AWS-Events2Panther**.

## Simulating an EC2 instance state change

Find your Lambda function, if you imported with default values it will be named **AWS-Events2Panther** and should be listed on [aws.amazon.com/lambda/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home){:target="_blank"}

You should see something like ![Default lambda function](./media/aws-lambda-panther.png)

### Sample test data

In order to test Events2Panther we'll need some test data, you can copy the example data below, or provide your own.

```json
{
   "id":"7bf73129-1428-4cd3-a780-95db273d1602",
   "detail-type":"EC2 Instance State-change Notification",
   "source":"aws.ec2",
   "account":"123456789012",
   "time":"2019-11-11T21:29:54Z",
   "region":"us-east-1",
   "resources":[
      "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-abcd1111"
   ],
   "detail":{
      "instance-id":"i-abcd1111",
      "state":"pending"
   }
}
```

It should look something like this:

![example EC2 state change](./media/example-ec2-state-change.png)

### Sending a sample event
